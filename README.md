Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is my final year project in Engineering.

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to assess the potability of water based on various key parameters.
By analyzing a dataset containing information on features like pH, hardness, and chloramine,the project addresses the crucial need for ensuring access to safe drinking water.
Through the implementation of a Random Forest classifier and a user-friendly graphical interface, users can input water quality metrics and receive predictions, contributing to the broader goal of safeguarding public health by identifying potable water sources.
